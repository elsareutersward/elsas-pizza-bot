# Pizza Bot

A project to practice some basic JavaScript and create a little text-based bot which you can use to order pizza on your computer. This project was made in my spare time as an extension to the project-pizza-bot (https://github.com/elsareutersward/project-pizza-bot), to incorporate more styling and user experience into the original design. 

## The problem

For this project I focused on creating a functional and interactive website for the user, while practicing executing good Javascript. Instead of having the pizza bot live in the console, I wanted to make a form in HTML for the input from the user, pizza type and number of pizzas to m,ake the site more interactive. I also wanted to make the pizza ordering with the help of clicking different images of pizzas instead of having the user type in the response and thus avoiding errors due to typos. Lastly I added some more CSS styling to the page and made it responsive.
